# unit-4-game

What this project does:
This project allows the user to play an RPG that is inspired by Game of Thrones.  Each of the 4 characters can be selected by the player, with the remaining characters becoming enemies that are fought one by one.  Attacking a chosen enemy decreases their hp by a continuously rising "attack power" and decreases the hp of the user's character by a static "counter attack power." The game is won by defeating all enemies.  A "game over" will be triggered when the user's hp drops to zero or below.

Why is this project useful:
The purpose of this project is to provide a challenging game for the user that requires strategy to beat.  Selecting enemies in the optmal order is critical for success.

How users can get started with this project:
After loading the page, a user can select characters by clicking on their pictures.  The attack button will be active only when a user has selected their character and an enemy to become the defender. Directions and information about the result of each attack will be shown on screen.
